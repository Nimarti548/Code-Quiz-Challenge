Code Quiz

- First I built the html to support a nav bar that contained the high scores as well as the timer.
- Next I began working on the javascript code for the quiz to work.
  - First I created the questions that would be used in the quiz, I created an object and put each question inside of the object.
  - Next I defined the variables that I would be using for the code.
  - Once that was completed I started creating my functions, the first being the start function to run the starting parameters for the quiz.
  - I then created a function for the end of the quiz that would help reset the quiz to the begining.
  - After that I created a vairable that would completely replace the text that appears inside the quizBody with the help of my tutor.
  - Then I created the function which would save the scores of the user to the local storage and one to retrieve the scores as well.
  - Once the score were up I created a button that would clear all scores and allow the user to start the quiz over.
  - I then created functions for losing time if the question was incorrect and one for adding points if the question was answered correctly.
  - Finally I created a function that had a conditional saying once the questions were all answered to end the game and it also had a for loop that would change the answers to pertain to each question and also to determin if the questions were answered right or wrong.
- To finish it all off I added some css to make it all look pretty.
